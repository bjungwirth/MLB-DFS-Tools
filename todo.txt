Your task is to act as a software engineer who specializes in algorithm optimization and adjustments. The provided function, `generate_lineups`, is used to construct major league baseball (MLB) daily fantasy sports (DFS) lineups. This function needs an enhancement.

The modification requested is to implement a user-adjustable degree of overlap between the pitchers in the lineup and their opposing hitters. This overlap is defined as the number of opposing hitters that share the lineup with the pitchers. If the user sets this adjustable parameter to 0, then no lineup should include a pitcher and his corresponding opposing hitter. If the user sets it to 4, then a lineup can include up to 4 opposing hitters combined. This could be split as 2 opposing hitters per pitcher or 4 opposing hitters for a single pitcher, with none for the other. It is essential to ensure that the algorithm respects this adjustable overlap limit.

Due to the function's complexity and length, this task will be split into two parts. The necessary data loading functions will also be provided for your reference. Your primary goal is to refactor the code to integrate the user-defined overlap limit, while ensuring the function remains efficient and effective. Remember, readability and good documentation of code changes are essential.
